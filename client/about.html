            <h1>About Deepstream</h1>

          <p>We’re a project from The Center for Civic Media at MIT’s Media Lab. Our goal is to make livestreams even more amazing by making them easier to find and letting people add interesting content to them.</p>

          <p>We were motivated to build this web platform because citizens and journalists are increasingly choosing to livestream civic events. But livestreams are currently hard to find and lack in-depth information about the events being documented.</p>

          <p>DeepStream seeks to expand participation this emergent form of media by creating a platform for livestream curation. By searching across multiple streaming websites, gathering groups of related livestreams together, and adding blog posts, news stories, images, tweets, and other media to livestreaming video, individuals or newsrooms can create immersive and interactive viewing experiences.</p>

          <p>We hope to design a platform that lets people have a new viewing experience that connects them to global events in a way that emphasizes local perspectives and deeper engagement, while maintaining the experience of immediacy and authenticity that is such an important part of livestreaming.</p>
            <p>Deepstream is built with love at the <b><a class="green" href="http://media.mit.edu" target="_blank">MIT Media Lab</a></b> with support from the <b><a class="green" href="https://civic.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Civic Media</a></b>.</p>

            <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
            <ul>
                <li class="question">What livestream sites do you search? How often are results updated?</li>
                <div class="answer">We currently search YouTube livestreams (including YouTube Gaming), Ustream, Bambuser, and Twitch. We’ll be adding more in the coming months. We update our database every few minutes, meaning our search results are really live, and not littered with the dead links you often find using other search engines.</div>
                <li class="question">Are there copyright problems with using livestreams in a DeepStream?</li>
                <div class="answer">We embed livestreams hosted by other service providers. That means view counts and other stats still go to the streamer. Live streaming websites also offer ways that streamers can turn off embedding so that the streams can’t exist on other websites. If a streamer has disabled embedding we respect that and don’t offer any way to watch that livestream. If you are the creator of a livestream and are unhappy that your stream is being shared on our site, please contact us at <a href="mailto:deepstream@media.mit.edu" class="green">deepstream@media.mit.edu</a>.</div>
                <li class="question">I’m having technical difficulties. Whom do I contact for support?</li>
