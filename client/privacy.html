            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>The DeepStream Team (“DeepStream”) is part of the Civic Media Group in the Media Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ("MIT"). DeepStream is a curation platform for enhancing live video with related content. DeepStream is committed to respecting the privacy of users who access the DeepStream website, including, but not limited to, the content, services, and functionalities made available within the www.deepstream.tv domain, any url that we manage that redirects to deepstream.tv, and any subdomains that are part of deepstream.tv (the “Site”). Please read this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) carefully before you visit the Site.</p>

            <h2>Web Server Logs</h2>
            <p>By accessing or using our web server, information may be recorded in the Site’s server log.</p>
            <p>We use server log information to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website by identifying which parts of our site are most heavily used. We also use this information to tailor site content to user needs and to generate aggregate statistical reports. Web server logs are retained on a temporary basis, during which time their contents are accessible to Site administrators and then deleted completely from our systems. Unless required by law or legal process, we do not link IP addresses to any personally identifiable information. This means that user sessions will be tracked by IP address, but a user’s identity will remain anonymous.</p>
            <p>In addition, we ordinarily do not disclose to third parties site usage by individual IP addresses, but we may do so in very limited circumstances when complying with law or legal process, working with consultants assisting us with fixing or improving the Site, or monitoring and improving the security of our network.</p>
