            <h1>Terms of Service</h1> <p>Thanks for using DeepStream! Before you start using the service, we want to make you aware of your rights as a user and some of our policies. These policies will likely evolve and change as DeepStream grows. We welcome any feedback you may have, and the team can be reached at <a class="green" href="mailto:deepstream@media.mit.edu">deepstream@media.mit.edu.</a> These terms are effective December 24, 2015.</p> </div>

            <h2>Some key words:</h2>
            <p><b>“A DeepStream”</b>: A DeepStream is the combination of a live streaming video and other relevant content displayed via Context Cards. Users create DeepStreams by finding one or more livestreams they want to curate and clicking "Create."</p>
            <p><b>“Context Cards”</b>: Context Cards are found to the right of the video player in a DeepStream. You can scroll through them or jump to any one using the card navigation stack. Context Cards bring in multimedia elements, including videos, maps, photos, text, and more.</p>
            <p><b>“Site”</b>: The "Site" below refers to the content, services, and functionalities made available within the <a href="http://www.deepstream.tv" target='_blank' class='green'> www.deepstream.tv</a>  domain, any url that we manage that redirects to deepstream.tv, and any subdomains that are part of deepstream.tv.</p>

These Terms of Service govern your use of deepstream.tv and all associated services.  References to “we,” “us,” “our” and “ours” refer to the DeepStream Team.  Please read the Terms of Service carefully. By using the Site you affirm that you have read, understood, and accept the terms and conditions in the Terms of Service. If you do not agree with any of these conditions, please do not use DeepStream.</p>
            <p>1.2 Your privacy is important to us. Please read our <a href="/privacy" target='_blank' class='green'>Privacy Policy</a>, which explains how the DeepStream Team uses, collects, and stores information it collects through the Services. By using the Site, you additionally agree that you are comfortable with the Site’s Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>1.3 You must be (a) 17 years or over or (b) 13 years or over and have obtained legal parental or guardian consent to access registration-only features on this Site. If we discover or have any reason to suspect that you have not met either of these conditions, then we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your registration to this Site immediately and without notice.</p>
            <p>1.4 We may publish amendments to these Terms of Service from time to time. You can always find the latest version of the Terms at deepstream.tv/terms.

            <h2>2. Account Creation and Maintenance</h2>
            <p>2.1 In order to use some features of the Site, you will need to register with the Site and create a user account. You can create an account with e-mail or through Twitter. You do not need a user account to view DeepStreams, but without an account you will not be able to create DeepStreams or favorite other users' DeepStreams. When you register for a personal account, you will be asked to provide certain personal information, such as your email address and name. Please see our <a href="/privacy" target='_blank' class='green'>Privacy Policy</a> for our data retention and usage policies.</p>
            <p>2.2 You are responsible for keeping your password secret and your account secure.

If any use of your account violates the Terms of Service, your account may be suspended or deleted.</p>
            <p>2.3 You may not use another person's user account without that person’s permission.</p>
            <p>2.4 At this point, account names cannot be changed, although this may change in the future and if so, these Terms of Service will be updated. If you want a different account name, create a new account.</p>
            <p>2.5 If you have reason to believe that your account is no longer secure (for example, in the event of a loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your password), promptly change your password. If you cannot access your account to change your password, notify us at <a class="green" href="mailto:deepstream@media.mit.edu">deepstream@media.mit.edu</a>.</p>

            <p>4.1 Context Cards can be created by incorporating content already hosted on third-party sites (e.g. YouTube, Flickr).  Your use of those third-party sites is subject to their Terms of Service.</p>
            <p>4.2 The DeepStream Team encourages its users to foster creativity by referencing and incorporating multimedia content like videos, maps, music, photos, and other works. However, we also understand the need for individuals and companies to protect their intellectual property rights.

            <p>4.3 By default, content that you, other users, and the DeepStream Team post on the Site is made available under a <a class="green" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC-BY)</a> license.</p>
            <p>4.4 By creating a "DeepStream," you grant to MIT and members of the DeepStream Team a worldwide, transferable, royalty-free, sublicensable and non-exclusive license to reproduce, publicly perform, publicly display, create derivative works of, and distribute the DeepStream at your direction and subject to your right to delete the content as provided below.</p>
            <p>4.5 You agree that upon creating and posting any Context Cards to DeepStream, you grant a CC-BY license in those Context Cards to MIT and members of the DeepStream Team. Under the CC-BY license, any downstream user who reuses, reposts, or remixes any Context Cards you produce must attribute the resulting works to you and link back to your DeepStream. You cannot permanently delete a Context Card once it has been used in another author’s DeepStream, though you may decide to remove any attribution linking the card to you. If you do not want to license your Context Cards under the CC-BY license, then do not create them on the DeepStream Site.</p>
            <p>4.6 You may delete your DeepStreams at any time. However, by posting a DeepStream you agree to allow us to store, display, publicize, and distribute it. We will never sell to third parties any of the content you post to DeepStream. We don’t screen content, but we reserve the right to remove any content you post to DeepStream. You are responsible for the content you post and assume all risks associated with it. By posting content, you represent and warrant that you have the necessary rights to post that content, that the content does not violate any applicable law or regulation, and that the content does not infringe or violate the rights of any third party.</p>
            <p>4.7 The DeepStream Team requires all users to comply with these Terms of Service, but even so, when you use DeepStream, you may be exposed to user-generated content that you find objectionable or offensive. If you see any content that you believe violates these Terms of Service, please let us know by either clicking the "inappropriate content" flag in the bottom right of the screen or directly emailing the team at <a class="green" href="mailto:deepstream@media.mit.edu">deepstream@media.mit,edu</a>. You only need to report an item once. The DeepStream Team frequently review reports of inappropriate content. We retain full discretion to determine whether and how to edit, move, or delete the content that you report.</p>
            <p>4.8 In addition to reviewing reported user-generated content, we reserve the right, but are not obligated, to monitor all uses of the DeepStream service. We may edit, move, or delete any content for any reason and without notice. We therefore advise you to keep a local copy of content that you author and post on DeepStream.</p>
            <p>4.9 The DeepStream Team does not endorse any views, opinions, or advice expressed in user-generated content. You agree to relieve the DeepStream Team of any and all liability arising from your user-generated content.</p>
