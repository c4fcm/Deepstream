            <h2>Some key words:</h2>
            <p><b>“A DeepStream”</b>: A DeepStream is the combination of a live streaming video and other relevant content displayed on context cards. Users create DeepStreams by finding one or more livestreams they want to curate and clicking "Create."</p> <p><b>“Context Cards”</b>: Context cards are found to the right of the video player in a DeepStream. You can scroll through them or jump to any one using the card navigation stack. Context cards bring in multimedia elements, including videos, maps, photos, text, and more.</p> <p><b>“Site”</b>: The "Site" below refers to <a href="http://www.deepstream.tv" target='_blank' class='green'> www.deepstream.tv</a> or any url that we manage that redirects to deepstream.tv or subdomains that are part of deepstream.tv.</p> <p><b>“Remixing”</b>: Any context card can be remixed by another author. If it is remixed, the new card will link back to the original story and provide attribution to the author who first created it.</p>
